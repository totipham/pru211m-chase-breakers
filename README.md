## Game Description

Chases Breaker is an infinity runner mobile game where players take on the role of a skilled thief trying to escape from relentless police officers. The thief must navigate through a cityscape filled with random height buildings, strategically jump from rooftop to rooftop, and overcome various obstacles to shake off the pursuing police.

## Features

- Randomness in the Game: Platforms are generated randomly and continuously. Along with that, accompanying obstacles are also randomly generated.
